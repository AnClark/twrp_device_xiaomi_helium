# TWRP Device configuration for Xiaomi Mi Max (helium) with Encryption Support.

Based on the former official configuration, I added ENCRYPTION SUPPORT.
So, you won't need to format data partition every time. 

You know, all your personal files are stored in the data partition since the former "Internal Storage" is no more a seperate partition. Remember, formatting data is always a worst solution!
